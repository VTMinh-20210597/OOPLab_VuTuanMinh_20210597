10. Unique Item in the list
	1. If the passing object is not an instance of Media, what happens?
		- the result of equals() is FALSE

11. Polymorphism
	1. Iterate through the list and print out the information of the media by using toString() method. Observe what happens and explain in detail.
		+ Result: The result of toString() if each subclass is printed
		+ Explain: so cd, dvd, book are declared are all Media. When toString method of a media is called, it call the toString method of actual object which maybe cd, dvd, book.

12. Sort Media in the cart
	1. What class should implement the Comparable interface? Media class
	2. How should I implement the compareTo() method to reflect the ordering you want?
		+ You want the list of media to be sorted in 2 way: (1) decreasing cost then title; (2) title then cost
		+ So I have to implement 2 functions in 1 method, then I will make a label inside the compareTo().
		So that the method could give different result due to each lable value. Flag values can be: "COST", "TITLE".
	3. Can we have two ordering rules of the item (by title then cost and by cost then title) if we use this Comparable interface approach?
		+ yes, but it does not mean we should.

	4. Suppose the DVDs has a different ordering rule from the other media types, that is by title, then decreasing length, then cost. How would you modify your code to allow this?
		+ Let DVD implement Comparable interface, apply that ordering rule for only DVD.
